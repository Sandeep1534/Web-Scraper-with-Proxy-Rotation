# Web-Scraper-with-Proxy-Rotation
Develop a robust web scraper that intelligently rotates through proxy IP addresses to  bypass geo-restrictions and anti-bot mechanisms. The system will handle CAPTCHAs  using third-party solving services, implement retry strategies for failed requests, and  extract structured data from target websites while avoiding detection.
